## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users.

### 2. Email us directly

Please email security details to: `security@example.com`

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 4. What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and provide updates
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

2. **Use virtual environments**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Run in secure environments**
   - Don't expose the dashboard to the public internet without proper authentication
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Keep your system and dependencies updated

4. **Monitor for updates**
   - Watch this repository for security updates
   - Subscribe to security advisories

### For Developers

1. **Dependency scanning**
   - Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
   - Use tools like `safety` and `bandit`

2. **Code review**
   - All code changes require review
   - Pay special attention to security-sensitive areas

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests in your test suite
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Input validation**: All API inputs are validated
- **Error handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Dependency management**: Regular updates and security scanning
- **HTTPS support**: Secure communication in production

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Authentication and authorization system
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Input sanitization improvements
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Audit logging

## Vulnerability Disclosure

When we discover or receive reports of security vulnerabilities, we will:

1. **Assess** the severity and impact
2. **Develop** a fix for supported versions
3. **Release** a security update
4. **Notify** users through:
   - GitHub security advisories
   - Release notes
   - Email notifications (for critical issues)

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Patch releases** (e.g., 1.0.1) for critical security fixes
- **Minor releases** (e.g., 1.1.0) for security improvements
- **Major releases** (e.g., 2.0.0) for significant security changes
